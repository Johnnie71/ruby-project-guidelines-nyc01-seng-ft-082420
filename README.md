# Avatar

## Origin

Avatar the movie directed by James Cameron is my favorite movie. The innovated technologies and message overall is what inspires my creativity. The need to preserve Earth and its environment are crucial to life. So we wanted to make a fun CLI game where a User can be an Avatar and explore the world of Pandora. User can navigate the world of Pandora and choose their paths. Watch out! Might be a choice for the worst or a completely thrilling adventure!
